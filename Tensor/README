  optimization 2.1.9

Tensor Network State Package(libTNSP) is a library of Fortran 90 with subroutines
or function for Tensor Network states(TNS). It is freely-available software,
and is copyrighted. If you have any question, send email to Shaojun Dong via

   sj.dong@outlook.com

The distribution tar file contains the Fortran source for libTNSP and the
testing programs, which is a PEPS with simple update method. To compile
the libTNSP, one should link the package to the lapack and blas.






===================
libTNSP INSTALLATION:
===================

 - libTNSP can be installed with make. Configuration have to be set in the
 make.inc file. A make.inc for a Linux machine(ubuntu16.04) running GNU
 compilers is given in the main directory. 
 
 - Do "make" in the current directory to build the standard library 
   "libTensor-4.1.3‚Äù. And other codes for makefile are:
   

                 make : installed the package with the configuration
                        in the file make.inc


           make clean : clean the files of *.o and *.mod according 
                        to the file make.inc
 
        make cleanAll : clean all the files of *.o, *.mod and the package

        make cleanlib : clean the package according to the file make.inc
        
       make cleanAlllib : clean All the packages

       make cleanAllMod : clean All the file of *.mod *.o
   
   
 - Use the code 
 
      "-I$(libTNSP)/libTensor-$(version) -L$(libTNSP)/libTensor-$(version) -llibTensor-$(version)" 
        
  to link your code with the libTNSP, where $(libTNSP) is the libTNSP directory.
  And make sure you have linked the libTNSP with the blas and lapack. If you
  use the package of eigvalue-4.1, the arpack is needed.
  
 
 - The libTNSP can not run under Windows yet. It test OK in linux and Mac.
