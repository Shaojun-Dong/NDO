modify the code in Tensor_include/product.f90:
   ProductTensorRoutine
   case(2)
   case(3)
   case(5)
   case(7)
Tesor ::A, B
A is [1,1,1,1] tensor
B is [1] tensor
A*B will regard as number ,but the dimension of the result will set to the dimension of A

Tesor ::A, B
A is [1] tensor
B is [1,1,1,1] tensor
A*B will regard as number ,but the dimension of the result will set to the dimension of B


if A or B is [1], it will be regard as a number

fix a bug of T+T, the bug is
if T is symmetry tensor, but there is no block in T, T+T return a 0 block tensro
